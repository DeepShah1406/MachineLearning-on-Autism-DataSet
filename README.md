# ***Machine Learning on Autism Data Set***

Autism ML Case Study: Exploring ASD prediction using Python and machine learning. Data preprocessing, model evaluation, and insights.

## Autism Spectrum Disorder Prediction using Machine Learning

### Project Overview
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on a dataset containing various features. The goal is to provide an accurate and reliable prediction model that can assist in the early detection and intervention for individuals with ASD.

### Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and patterns.
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Model training and evaluation using Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Performance metrics analysis with ROC-AUC scores and confusion matrix visualization.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models and metrics
- Imbalanced-learn for handling imbalanced datasets

## Results
The models achieved the following results:

- Logistic Regression: Training Accuracy: **86.74%**, Validation Accuracy: **78.23%**
- XGBClassifier: Training Accuracy: **100%**, Validation Accuracy: **69.94%**
- SVM (Support Vector Machine): Training Accuracy: **93.76%**, Validation Accuracy: **81.81%**

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the models in predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with varying degrees of accuracy.
